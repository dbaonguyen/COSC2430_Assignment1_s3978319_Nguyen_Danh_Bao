                <h1>Description: </h1>
                <p>
                    Sally Milz is a sketch writer for The Night Owls, a late-night live comedy show that airs every
                    Saturday. With a couple of heartbreaks under her belt, she’s long abandoned the search for love,
                    settling instead for the occasional hook-up, career success, and a close relationship with her
                    stepfather to round out a satisfying life.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    But when Sally’s friend and fellow writer Danny Horst begins dating Annabel, a glamorous actress who
                    guest-hosted the show, he joins the not-so-exclusive group of talented but average-looking and even
                    dorky men at the show—and in society at large—who’ve gotten romantically involved with incredibly
                    beautiful and accomplished women. Sally channels her annoyance into a sketch called the Danny Horst
                    Rule, poking fun at this phenomenon while underscoring how unlikely it is that the reverse would
                    ever happen for a woman.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Enter Noah Brewster, a pop music sensation with a reputation for dating models, who signed on as
                    both host and musical guest for this week’s show. Dazzled by his charms, Sally hits it off with Noah
                    instantly, and as they collaborate on one sketch after another, she begins to wonder if there might
                    actually be sparks flying. But this isn’t a romantic comedy—it’s real life. And in real life,
                    someone like him would never date someone like her . . . right?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    With her keen observations and trademark ability to bring complex women to life on the page, Curtis
                    Sittenfeld explores the neurosis-inducing and heart-fluttering wonder of love, while slyly
                    dissecting the social rituals of romance and gender relations in the modern age.
                </p>
