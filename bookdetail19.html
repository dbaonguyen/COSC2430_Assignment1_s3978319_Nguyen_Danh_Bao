                <h1>Description: </h1>
                <p>The Tale of Peter Rabbit is the original classic by Beatrix Potter. The Tale of Peter Rabbit was
                    first published by Frederick Warne in 1902 and endures as Beatrix Potter's most popular and
                    well-loved tale. It tells the story of a very mischievous rabbit and the trouble he encounters in Mr
                    McGregor's vegetable garden! Re-originated in 2002 to mark the centenary of publication bringing it
                    closer to the original edition, six illustrations were restored, four that were removed in 1903 to
                    make room for endpapers and two that have never been used before, Beatrix having initially prepared
                    more illustrations than could be accommodated in the original format. Beatrix Potter is regarded as
                    one of the world's best-loved children's authors of all time.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>From her first book, The Tale of Peter Rabbit, published by Frederick Warne in 1902, she went on to
                    create a series of stories based around animal characters including Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, Benjamin
                    Bunny, Jemima Puddle-duck, Mr. Jeremy Fisher and Tom Kitten. Her humorous, lively tales and
                    beautiful illustrations have become a natural part of childhood. With revenue from the sales of her
                    books, Beatrix Potter bought a farm - Hill Top - in the English Lake District, where she later
                    became a farmer and prize-winning sheep breeder. She launched the now vast merchandise programme by
                    patenting the very first Peter Rabbit doll in 1903. The product range continues to grow today with
                    licences around the world including baby clothing and bedding, nursery decor products and
                    collectables. Upon her death, Beatrix Potter left 14 farms and over 4000 acres of Lake District
                    farmland to the National Trust so that the place that she loved would remain undeveloped and
                    protected for future generations to enjoy.

                <p>
                    Today Beatrix Potter's original 23 tales are still published by Frederick Warne, alongside a wide
                    range of other formats including baby books, activity books and gift and sound books. The Tale of
                    Peter Rabbit is number one in Beatrix Potter's series of 23 little books. Look out for the rest! 1
