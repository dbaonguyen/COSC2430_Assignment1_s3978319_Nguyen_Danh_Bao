                <h1>Description: </h1>
                <p>Technologies may change, but the need for clear and accurate communication never goes out of style.
                    That is why for more than one hundred years The Chicago Manual of Style has remained the definitive
                    guide for anyone who works with words.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In the seven years since the previous edition debuted, we have seen an extraordinary evolution in
                    the way we create and share knowledge. This seventeenth edition of The Chicago Manual of Style has
                    been prepared with an eye toward how we find, create, and cite information that readers are as
                    likely to access from their pockets as from a bookshelf. It offers updated guidelines on electronic
                    workflows and publication formats, tools for PDF annotation and citation management, web
                    accessibility standards, and effective use of metadata, abstracts, and keywords. It recognizes the
                    needs of those who are self-publishing or following open access or Creative Commons publishing
                    models. The citation chapters reflect the ever-expanding universe of electronic sources—including
                    social media posts and comments, private messages, and app content—and also offer updated guidelines
                    on such issues as DOIs, time stamps, and e-book locators.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Other improvements are independent of technological change. The chapter on grammar and usage
                    includes an expanded glossary of problematic words and phrases and a new section on syntax as well
                    as updated guidance on gender-neutral pronouns and bias-free language. Key sections on punctuation
                    and basic citation style have been reorganized and clarified. To facilitate navigation, headings and
                    paragraph titles have been revised and clarified throughout. And the bibliography has been updated
                    and expanded to include the latest and best resources available.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This edition continues to reflect expert insights gathered from Chicago’s own staff and from an
                    advisory board of publishing experts from across the profession. It also includes suggestions
                    inspired by emails, calls, and even tweets from readers. No matter how much the means of
                    communication change, The Chicago Manual of Style remains the ultimate resource for those who care
                    about getting the details right.
                </p>
